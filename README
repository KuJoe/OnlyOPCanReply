1) Upload the included \inc\ folder into your forums root directory (this will result in 1 opcr.php file in your \plugins\ directory).
2) Activate the plugin and configure the settings to your liking under Board Settings.

\\Additional Info:\\
_\\________________\\_
This plugin was created to emulate the vBulletin permission "Can Reply to Own Threads" or "Can Reply to Others' Threads" (depending on how you look at it) which I use for quite a few things. I considered adding this as an actual permission for Usergroups but I decided not to get to indepth with it. You are free to use this code and plugin as long as it follows the Expat "MIT" License requirements and restrictions.
